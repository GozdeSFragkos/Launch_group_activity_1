# group_activity
Through this activity, we will collaborate in groups to develop HTML pages on lessons learned from the Covid 19 response using text, images, and links . The collaborations will help to showcase the power of Git in version control, along with the practicalities of using key functions via GitHub and GitHub Desktop.

Utilizing branching, along with adds and commits and pushes and pulls between your local and remote repositories, will be useful to reduce conflicts and improve overall presentation. It will also allow for more real-time experimentation.

Please work as a team, with each person using their role (P1, P2, P3, or P4) noted in the activity document and based on the designations provided prior to the breakout rooms. We know that some of this may be a struggle, and that is just part of the learning process. Data Elevates and PJMF staff are here to support as well, so let us know if issues arise.

Finally, you may need HTML markdown syntax information for this activity, most of which can be found here: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/.

Good luck and enjoy!!!
